title: "'What's wrong with this product?': Detection of product safety issues based on information consumers share online"

permalink: /publication/whats_wrong_with_this_product
excerpt: 'With the widespread use of e-commerce, proper oversight and regulatory compliance become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, resulting in a heightened risk of harm to consumers from unsafe products. In this paper, we explore how online consumer reviews can be utilized to identify hazardous products that have previously been flagged in the European Union Safety Gate reports. Our research presents a general framework that can be beneficial for regulatory authorities, as well as a specific application to consumer electronics. We contribute a dataset of 3000 reviews of electronic products, 755 of which reference hazardous products, and conduct classification baselines, achieving an AUC of up to 80% with room for improvement. Furthermore, we discuss the legal basis for annotation and potential issues that may arise. Our proposed methodology and dataset are valuable resources for regulatory authorities in the European Union and provide evidence of the effectiveness of digital surveillance in protecting consumers.'

The ability to autonomously navigate safely, especially within dynamic environments, is paramount for mobile robotics. In recent years, DRL approaches have shown superior performance in dynamic obstacle avoidance. However, these learning-based approaches are often developed in specially designed simulation environments and are hard to test against conventional planning approaches. Furthermore, the integration and deployment of these approaches into real robotic platforms are not yet completely solved. In this paper, we present Arena-bench, a benchmark suite to train, test, and evaluate navigation planners on different robotic platforms within 3D environments. It provides tools to design and generate highly dynamic evaluation worlds, scenarios, and tasks for autonomous navigation and is fully integrated into the robot operating system. To demonstrate the functionalities of our suite, we trained a DRL agent on our platform and compared it against a variety of existing different model-based and learning-based navigation approaches on a variety of relevant metrics. Finally, we deployed the approaches towards real robots and demonstrated the reproducibility of the results.
