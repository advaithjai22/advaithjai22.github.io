This project was performed as a part of the Building and Mining Knowledge Graphs course. In this project, I built a movie recommendation system based on knowledge graphs. In order to do this, first an knowledge graph was created by combining the movie titles available on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney+ containing data like the cast members and director. Then these titles were searched on the MovieLens dataset and the ratings for it and a knowledge graph was built with this information. These two knowledge graphs were then linked to create an integrated knowledge graph. ComplEx and TransE models were used for link prediction and their results were evaluated using Mean Reciprocal Rank, Mean Rank and Hits@N scores.
