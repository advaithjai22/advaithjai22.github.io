👨🏻‍💻 I'm a graduate from Maastricht University.

🔬 My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Explainable AI.

📚 In my Master's Thesis, I explored Explainable AI approaches to produce explainable predictions for a diabetic retinopathy detection model.

# Selected Experience



## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
