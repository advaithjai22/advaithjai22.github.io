👨🏻‍💻 I'm a graduate from Maastricht University looking for research and job opportunities in the field of Data Science.

🔬 My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Explainable AI.

📚 In my Master's Thesis, I explored Explainable AI approaches to produce explainable predictions for a diabetic retinopathy detection model.

## 🔬 Research Experience
In my masters programme, I had to do two group research projects as a part of my studies. These projects helped me develop my research skills, people and time management skills. I chose projects in the domain of Natural Language Processing for both of my projects. In my first project, I worked in a team of five to build a system than can classify skills into soft skills and hard skills and assign them to domains from job postings. We used word emebeddings as linguistic features and evaluated various classification models on them.

For my second research project, I picked a project offered by the Law and Tech lab of the Law faculty in my university. In this project, our team of three built a system to classify products as hazardous or non hazardous based on their online reviews. Also in this project, we used word embeddings as features and evaluated various classification models on them. This research work was awarded the Silver Award in the EU Product Safety Awards by the European Commission and published in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL ’23).


## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I started my career in May 2019 when I joined Thurro (known previously as Adqvest Capital). Here I was responsible for writing scripts to scrape data from webpages in an automated manner. I was also responsible for maintaining the cloud infrastructure (AWS) and the database (RDBMS). In this job, I learnt to work with Python, R and MySQL as well as AWS for maintaing the cloud infrastructure. I quit this job in March of 2021 to pursure my masters.  

During the course of my masters, I opted to do an elective and a thesis internship. In my elective internship at Unilever in Rotterdam, I supported the Global Customer Development team with deliverables. As my main project, I created a time series forecasting model to predict long term deman across channels (supermarkets, discounters etc) in key cells (combination of product, location and channel) and also created automated dashboards.

I did my thesis internship at Thirona Retina in Nijmegen which is a leader in AI solutions for eye disease screening. I implemented explainability models for the diabetic retinopathy models used by the company by creating attribution maps to visualize the regions of the image responsible for the classification. I also implemented quantitative methods of measuring quality of explanations generated.
