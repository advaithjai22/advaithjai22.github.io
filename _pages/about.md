👨🏻‍💻 I'm a graduate from Maastricht University looking for research and job opportunities in the field of Data Science.

🔬 My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Explainable AI.

📚 In my Master's Thesis, I explored Explainable AI approaches to produce explainable predictions for a diabetic retinopathy detection model.

# Selected Experience

## 🔬 Research Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
I started my career in May 2019 when I joined Thurro (known previously as Adqvest Capital). Here I was responsible for writing scripts to scrape data from webpages in an automated manner. I was also responsible for maintaining the cloud infrastructure (AWS) and the database (RDBMS). In this job, I learnt to work with Python, R and MySQL as well as AWS for maintaing the cloud infrastructure. I quit this job in March of 2021 to pursure my masters.  
During the course of my masters, I opted to do an elective and a thesis internship. In my elective internship at Unilever in Rotterdam, I supported the Global Customer Development team with deliverables. As my main project, I created a time series forecasting model to predict long term deman across channels (supermarkets, discounters etc) in key cells (combination of product, location and channel) and also created automated dashboards.
I did my thesis internship at Thirona Retina in Nijmegen which is a leader in AI solutions for eye disease screening. I implemented explainability models for the diabetic retinopathy models used by the company by creating attribution maps to visualize the regions of the image responsible for the classification. I also implemented quantitative methods of measuring quality of explanations generated.
